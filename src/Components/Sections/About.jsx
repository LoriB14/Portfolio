        <p>
          I'm a computer science student and emerging developer with a strong interest in 
          building clean, modern, and user-friendly web experiences. I'm still learning, 
          but I'm dedicated, curious, and constantly improving my skills through hands-on 
          projects and real problem-solving.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy exploring front-end development, UI/UX design, and the technologies 
          behind modern web applications. Every project I work on is an opportunity to 
          grow, experiment, and push myself to learn something new.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of school, I'm focused on building my portfolio, strengthening my 
          technical foundation, and gaining experience that will help me become a 
          well-rounded developer. My goal is to create meaningful digital experiences 
          while continuously improving my skills.
